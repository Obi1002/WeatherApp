# WeatherApp
 
For this project, I aim to create an accurate weather app that will allow users to better prepare for their days and trips.  This weather app will utilize the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. My main motivation for this project is to utilize Bootstrap, jQuery, and moment to create a more accurate weather predictions. To ensure the accessiblity of the app, there will be a visual of the days' temperature in 'F' and predicted weather art. Being able to accomplish this weathr app will increase the accuracy of any user's day or traveler's .    

# Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
